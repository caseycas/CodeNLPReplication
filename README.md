# CodeNLPReplication
Replication Package for "Studying the Difference Between Natural and Programming Language Corpora"

# Basic Replication
A description of how to quickly replicate the results of the paper can be found in EntropyModel/README.md

# Detail Replication
Generating your own training/test corpora from the original files involves lexing, running tensorflow, kenlm, with a variety of pre- and post-processing to at various steps.  We are currently looking at cleaning up the code/providing instructions to allow replication of these steps.

The corpora used in these experiments (with the exception of the Penn Treebank which requires your own license), can be downloaded from:

(TODO Provide download link for the raw datasets).
